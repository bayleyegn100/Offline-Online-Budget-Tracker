## Description 

By using this application a user can add expenses or/and deposit to thier budget both online and offline. A starter code only let the users to add expence and deposit to thier budget only when they are online or only when there is a connection. So this app let the users able to track thier with drawals and deposits with or without interenet connection. 
The application designed for any one who want to use it. To develop this application I used diffrent technologies including indexdb, which called a transactional database system, Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm), express, Mongo data base, Mongoose, node.js and other relevant node.js frameworks.

If you want to test the app first open the application by using localhost:3000 or by using a live url and make your internet connecion offline mode. Following that add inputs inside name of transation and transaction ammount placholders and press on the + or - buttons depending on your budget transaction. Next inspect your the devtol and click on application and then under indexDB you will find a budget file link. When you click on that you will see your transactions. Now turn on your connection and refresh your page and your mongodb. The previous transaction information you had inside indexDB will be posted on mongoDB.
